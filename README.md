# React TypeScript Template with Vite

This template provides a solid starting point for your React projects with TypeScript, Vite, React Router DOM, ESLint (using the Airbnb config), Prettier, and Vitest pre-configured. It offers a robust foundation for developing modern, scalable React applications.

## Features

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to your JavaScript, making your code more predictable and less error-prone.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that leverages ES modules, resulting in rapid development and production builds.
- **React Router DOM**: A declarative routing library for React, making it easy to handle navigation and views.
- **ESLint (Airbnb config)**: A widely-used JavaScript linter that enforces coding standards to keep your code clean and maintainable.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style.
- **Vitest**: A lightweight and fast test runner for JavaScript and TypeScript projects.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: A popular React UI framework for creating beautiful and responsive user interfaces.

4. **Install dependencies:**

   `npm install`

5. **Start the development server:**

   `npm run dev`

   This will start the development server and open your app in your default web browser.

6. **Run tests:**

   `npm test`

7. **Build for production:**

   `npm run build`

   The production-ready code will be generated in the `dist` directory.

8. **Lint your code:**

   To ensure your code follows the ESLint and Prettier rules, run:

   `npm run lint`

## Folder Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains your application source code.
- `public/`: Holds static assets and the HTML template.
- `test/`: For your test files.
- `dist/`: The production build output directory.

## Configuration

- ESLint and Prettier configuration can be found in `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.js` respectively.
- Vitest configuration can be found in `vite.config.js`.
